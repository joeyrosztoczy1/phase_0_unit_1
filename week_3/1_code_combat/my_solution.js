 // Questions
 // this refers to an object itself once it has been selected
 // () calls a function in js
 // The semicolons allow for multiple lines of code to run, I believe it breaks after code is executed.
 
 
 
 
// Reflection:
// Write your reflection here.

// The exercises were straight forward and simple. I appreciated the analogies to gaming ( I am a big gamer). I didn't really run
// into too many challenges. I liked the time breakdown, similar to stepping through code as you debug it. I didn't have any 
// outside questions from the exercises. I had used js before so not too much learned other than that using this is similar to 
// Ruby. The last challenge was by far the most fun because you weren't boxed in by walls and could be as creative 
// as you wanted to be. Not being able to see the end goal in some of the challenges until halfway through was 
// the most tedious part for sure.
