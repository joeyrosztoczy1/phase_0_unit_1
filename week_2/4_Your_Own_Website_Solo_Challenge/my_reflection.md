# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: joeyrosztoczy1.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I learned to appreciate design on a totally new level. The user experience portion was the most interesting part to me, and I loved how it incorporated work flow, design, usability, accessability, etc. I learned that I am not in it alone even though I am totally useless from an artistic perspective. There are plenty of guides and tools to aide in the design process.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I like the outcome of well-designed sites and am amazingly impressed. Design for me is incredibly difficult. Even after spending a few hours trying to understand how to build a css grid I pretty much failed completely. And I believe that that is one of the fundamental and simpler pieces of website layout and design. That part is incredibly frustrating.


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I pretty much went to the wireframe page. Right now the design is just a classic plog with a large photo header and than the content below. I am not really sure what the flow will look like in future versions because I do not know how to add content besides text and basic images. I would like to implement frameworks like bootstrap but don't think we can yet.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I am a data freak. I would love to add a data visualization of some kind, like git commits or page tracking analytics.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Yes. I think I totally failed at the grid. With more time next week I know I could start to make some serious improvements to it. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
