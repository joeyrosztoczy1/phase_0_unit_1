# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

So far it has been my current job. I was working about 60 hours a week but we just had some turnover in the software department and thanks to my recent interest in software I have been shifted over there to manage the IT staff and reasses the technologies we are using. Due to my lack of experience this has  boosted my time required to over 75 hours a week and made it hard to keep up these last two weeks.

* How will you combat that? 

I think the first two weeks were by far the hardest as I had to get familiar with our systems and technologies. I believe moving forward I can actually synergize my research into new technologies with some of my work from devBootcamp. I think time-boxing devBootcamp activities like I already do at work will help me maintain productivity as well.

* What techniques will you try?

Timeboxing definitely, also using some of the GTD methods from "Getting Things Done" and moving tasks from Github to Asana which I use for project management at work. I used to meditate during college and have been recently restarting that practice with the aid of an app on my phone. I think if I can get it 5 30min mediations a week it will help from a proactive standpoint to combat less sleep and longer work hours.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I am going to treat it like I do projects at work, and try and mix in some software strategies like scrum/agile. One problem I had this week was not spending time to look forward at the tasks and projects and plan out my week. I will take an hour on each Monday to plan and timeblock out the weeks work.
