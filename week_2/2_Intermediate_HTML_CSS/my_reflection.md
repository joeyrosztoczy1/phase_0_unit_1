# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* 
 Web standards are freaking awesome. Without them the web would be a nightmare to develop for, and browers and their organizations would get headaches up the wazoo.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

It is actually not very intuitive for me. The way that all of the elements align and relate to one another on the document is very confusing as well. At least the new HTML5 elements are descriptive by nature and I won't have to deal with as much div-itis!

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

Yes! For the reasons above!

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

The reset.css is necessary to help render the styling correctly in older and different types of browsers from the most modern!

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I am not a fan that they can render quite differently, it makes design and development significantly more time consuming. Although I suppose the fact that they render differently introduces opportunities for flexibility, not just complexity.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
