# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

DOM is an API for interacting with HTML and CSS. It helps translate the documents into an object oriented system that programming languages and scripts can interact with. It is good it is not relegated to one language. It seems bad that HTML couldn't natively provide this functionality.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

It gives awesome perspective as to how light-weight what I threw together was and what real development can produce in a professional setting.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

I loved these tools, and I think that having to do a lot of analysis prior to these tools must have been significantly more challenging so thank you Google and thank you web tools. They are awesome.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I had an aha moment as to finding out how to help optimize the page load. Will be using this a lot I believe.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
