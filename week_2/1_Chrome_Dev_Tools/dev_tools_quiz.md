##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
    The elements tab supports this editing-- you can edit as html and add/delete elements and CSS straight from here into a localized copy.

  * Javascript Debugging
    You can access this capability under "Sources" and look at the error notifications in the top right.
  * Performance Optimization 
    The network tab helps with performance optimization as does pageSpeed if you have installed the Google-created Chrome tool.

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  
    color: #afafaf;
   	background-color: #0b0f11;

  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.
  You can load the site without cache while recording reload and the url is the one posted above.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
