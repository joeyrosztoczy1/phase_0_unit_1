# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is fantastic. It is the practice of designing a website to respond to different display types, sizes, resolutions, and input methods. It is a counter-method to creating distincly separate websites for every type of display. Instead of a desktop and mobile site, you have one site that can fluidly conform to both.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Without smartphones and tablets I am not sure that responsive web design would have seen the revolution it recently did. They forced widespread adoption because it became infeasible to code designs separately for all device types and sizes-- from an economic perspective and time perspective.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them

I believe the web is still a massively important resource for the visually impaired. Although screen readers are more cumbersome and less intuitive to those of us with functioning eyesight, they allow for large digestions of information for the viusally impaired. We should absolutely design and develop for them, just as we design and develop our buildings and roads.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Responsive design, grids, and layouts all really resonated with me. The standard layout seems kind of stupid to me, it has been very hard to figure out how to make a responsive grid without a plug and play framework.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
